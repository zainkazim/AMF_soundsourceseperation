# Project Title: Adaptive Matched Filter Implementation for Sound Source Seperation 

## Description
This project focuses on the enhancement of the **FastMNMF** algorithm. The goal is to develop an adaptive filter to enhance audio processing capabilities.

## Files Overview
- **adaptive_filter.py**: This is the main script that implements the FastMNMF algorithm.
- **resources.txt**: This file contains links to essential concepts and resources related to the project.
- **roadmap.txt**: This file outlines the project roadmap, detailing the sequence of tasks to be completed.

### Audio Files
Two `.wav` files have been included in the repository. Project members can define their paths to these files to run the script successfully.

## How to Run the Script
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the two `.wav` files are correctly referenced in your script.
3. Run the **adaptive_filter.py** script to start processing.

## Project Goals
The roadmap outlines the step-by-step process for implementing the adaptive matched filter. It serves as a guide for project members to follow and track their progress.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute by adding more resources, suggesting improvements, or enhancing the implementation.
